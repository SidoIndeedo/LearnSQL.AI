# QueryGuru 🧠💬  
*Your AI-powered Hinglish-to-SQL learning assistant.*

## 🚀 What is QueryGuru?

QueryGuru is an intelligent Hinglish-to-SQL translator designed to **help students and beginners** write and understand SQL queries — even if they're not fluent in English or SQL syntax.

Think of it like having a **smart teaching assistant** that lets you speak your thoughts in casual Hinglish, and guides you toward writing correct, optimized SQL.

## ✨ Features

- 🔤 Translate **Hinglish + broken SQL** into clean SQL queries
- 💡 Automatically detects errors and routes complex queries to **AI fallback**
- 🤖 Works as a friendly **SQL tutor**, not just a translator
- 🧱 Built with modular architecture for scalability and AI integrations
- 📦 Future-ready: Designed to plug into custom SQL clients or dashboards

## 🎯 Why This Project?

SQL is powerful — but for many students, the **syntax barrier** becomes a blocker. QueryGuru was created to:

- Help students write queries in the language they *think* in  
- Encourage trial-and-error without fear of syntax errors  
- Make database learning more human and more fun
